# Hello!

This is the Rmarkdown document!  
But surprise: It is linked to overleaf via Github!


And this is a line:  
```{r}
plot(1:100, 1:100)
```

You can knit this document, which will create a .tex file. Before you push it to Github, you have to run

`./trimtex.sh filename.tex`

in the shell!

Then you can push the document!
